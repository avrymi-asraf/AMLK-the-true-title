## Project Goal

* **Description:** AMLK is a Hebrew **news** summarization research project. The goal is to fine-tune `Qwen/Qwen3-2B` on Hebrew journalism datasets (HeSum, IAHLT summarization_he), evaluate with ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge, and produce a research paper and presentation. Design choices are informed by **English summarization literature** (lead bias, metric limits, strong baselines) without re-running English experiments. Evaluation includes an **advanced-model baseline** (e.g. Gemini API on the same test set and prompt) so metrics can be interpreted against a stronger system. A **truncation / positional-shortcut probe** trains separate models on Whole text, Lead-only, and Body-only inputs. Optional **headline-style control** varies the instruction (short headline vs longer summary). **Error analysis** labels a sampled set of predictions for failure types common in the literature. Runs locally or on HuggingFace Jobs; all scripts are command-line Python.

## Project Structure - remember to update it when you make changes

* **Architecture:** The project is divided into three sequential pipelines:
  1. **Training pipeline** — downloads Hebrew summarization datasets (IAHLT summarization_he, HeSum), loads the `Qwen/Qwen3-2B` base model, and fine-tunes it using the HuggingFace `transformers`/`trl` stack. If local GPU is insufficient, the job is submitted to HuggingFace as a remote training job.
  2. **Evaluation pipeline** — runs fine-tuned and baseline checkpoints on the held-out test set: ROUGE, BERTScore, LLM-as-judge (Gemini), an advanced-model baseline on the same data, and systematic error analysis on a sampled subset.
  3. **Results & reporting** — aggregated metrics feed into the final paper and presentation.

* **Code Flow:**
  1. Dataset download & preprocessing → tokenised dataset saved to disk
  2. Model fine-tuning → checkpoint saved to disk / HF Hub
  3. Inference on test set → predictions saved to disk
  4. Evaluation scripts consume predictions → produce metric reports
  5. Reports feed the paper / presentation

```

* `data/download.py`: Downloads Hebrew summarization datasets (biunlp/HeSum; IAHLT/summarization_he inaccessible with current credentials), normalises to `{text, summary, source}`, writes `outputs/data/raw/combined.jsonl`.
* `data/preprocess.py`: Reads `combined.jsonl`, builds `(prompt, completion)` pairs for completion-only SFT, applies the `--variant whole|lead|body` truncation probe (`make_variant`), truncates each article to `MAX_LENGTH-256` tokens so the summary always survives (HeSum articles are long — median ~2500 tokens; without this, completion-only loss goes nan), splits 80/10/10, saves Arrow splits to `outputs/data/processed/<variant>/`. `build_prompt`/`make_variant` are the single source of truth, reused by `evaluation/predict.py`.
* `training/config.py`: Shared constants: `MODEL_ID="Qwen/Qwen3-2B"`, `METHOD_PRESETS` (the qlora/lora/full deltas), `LoRAConfig` (r=32, alpha=64, q/k/v/o + gate/up/down_proj), `TrainingConfig`, `WANDB_PROJECT`, and `dataset_repo`/`model_repo` Hub-id helpers.
* `training/train.py`: One trainer for all three regimes (`--method qlora|lora|full`). Trains with `completion_only_loss=True`, logs to wandb, saves the adapter; `--push-to-hub` or `--submit-hf` push to the Hub. Inference is NOT here — that's `evaluation/predict.py`.
* `training/train_hf_job.py`: Self-contained PEP 723 UV script submitted inline by `train.py --submit-hf`. Reads METHOD/VARIANT/DATASET_REPO/OUTPUT_REPO/WANDB_PROJECT from env, trains on the cloud GPU, then generates fine-tuned + zero-shot base test predictions (PEFT `disable_adapter`) and pushes the adapter + `predictions-finetuned.jsonl` / `predictions-base.jsonl` to the Hub. Never run directly.
* `evaluation/predict.py`: Generates the Gemini advanced-baseline summaries via API (no GPU, no model load), same prompt as training. Resumes from a partial file. The fine-tuned and zero-shot predictions come from the cloud training job, not here. Also defines `strip_think()` — the shared tool that drops closed Qwen3 `<think>…</think>` reasoning so metrics score the summary, not the reasoning (used by evaluate.py and error_analysis.py).
* `evaluation/evaluate.py`: Scores a predictions file with raw + Hebrew-normalized ROUGE-1/2/L (`normalize_hebrew` strips niqqud + folds final-form letters), BERTScore (default `onlplab/alephbert-base`, the HeSum backbone; `--bertscore-model` to override), and the Gemini faithfulness/fluency judge (`--skip-llm` to skip; `--limit N` to cap for a smoke run). Applies `strip_think` before scoring. One JSON report per system.
* `evaluation/error_analysis.py`: Samples ~50 predictions (post `strip_think`) and has Gemini label failure types (hallucination, omission, entity/number error, lead copying, fluency), writing per-type rates.
* `evaluation/eval_hf_job.py`: Runs the whole D1 battery on HuggingFace Jobs so the ~4000 Gemini calls + BERTScore happen on the cloud's fast connection (the user has weak internet). One file, two modes: `--submit-hf` uploads itself to a cheap CPU job; with no args (how HF Jobs invokes it) it fetches the public repo + Hub predictions/dataset and drives the existing `evaluation/` CLIs by subprocess, pushing each report to the model repo under `reports/` as it finishes (timeout-safe).
* `evaluation/build_report_tables.py`: Downloads the pushed `reports/*.json` and assembles the D1 markdown — a quality table (ROUGE/BERTScore/judge), a failure-rate table, and behavioural notes (base `<think>`/language leakage, fine-tuned repetition, judge self-preference caveat).
* `evaluation/infer.py`: GPU inference helpers — `load_finetuned_model` (base + LoRA adapter, `disable_adapter()` gives the zero-shot base) and `generate_summaries` (batched greedy decode over a processed split). The importable twin of `train_hf_job.py`'s inline generation block (that cloud script can't import repo code); keep the two in sync. **Remote GPU only — never call locally.**
* `evaluation/topic_clustering.py`: Topic-clustering side-analysis (not part of the main pipeline). Embeds truncated article `text` by default (`embed_field='text'`) — summaries alone collapsed ~99% of docs into one media-meta mega-topic — with the Hebrew-native, clustering-tuned `dicta-il/neodictabert-bilingual-embed`, clusters with BERTopic (UMAP + HDBSCAN + Hebrew-only c-TF-IDF vectorizer, `HEBREW_STOPWORDS` + `MEDIA_STOPWORDS` + `BOILERPLATE_STOPWORDS`), names each real cluster with one Gemini call, then optionally `refine_large_clusters()` — a second finer HDBSCAN pass on any cluster holding ≥30% of docs (re-uses embeddings; splits e.g. the politics mega-topic into ביטחון/כלכלה/חברה sub-domains without re-fragmenting sports/legal), then `merge_duplicate_labels()` collapses any clusters Gemini still named identically (on by default via `cluster_dataset(merge_duplicates=True)`) so the report has one row per distinct real-world topic. `fit_topics` tunables: `min_cluster_size`/`min_samples` (default 60/15 — coarser granularity means fewer near-duplicate sub-clusters of the same domain), `outlier_threshold` (only reassign noise above cosine sim — default 0.35; 0 floods the largest cluster), optional `nr_topics` merge (off by default; `auto` over-merged), `language='multilingual'` (required — English mode strips Hebrew). `plot_topic_sizes()` renders a bar chart of `topic_summary()` for the notebook. Output `topics.jsonl` still keyed by `summary` for stratification join. See `notebooks/cluster_topics_databricks.py`.
* `evaluation/style_labels.py`: A second, independent per-summary dimension from topic clustering — not *what topic* an article is about but *what format* its summary takes (`single_sentence` / `multi_sentence` / `pipe_digest` / `question`). Pure regex (`classify_style`), no embeddings/GPU/API, so unlike topic clustering it never needs Databricks and has no `datasets` import (works even if that import is broken locally, see the lzma note below). Motivated by a real corpus pattern: ~26% of HeSum summaries are `"headline | headline | headline"` pipe-separated digests, already flagged in `docs/obsidian/Current Results.md` as shaping the fine-tuned model's output format. Produces the same `{summary: label}` artifact shape as `topic_clustering.py` so it plugs into the same stratification tool; `plot_style_distribution()` renders a bar chart of `style_summary()` for the notebook.
* `evaluation/stratify_by_topic.py`: Joins a predictions file to a label artifact (`topics.jsonl`'s `topic_label` from `topic_clustering.py`, or `style_labels.jsonl`'s `style_label` from `style_labels.py` — same shape, selected via `--label-field`) on exact `reference`==`summary` text match, and reuses `evaluate.py`'s `compute_rouge`/`compute_bertscore` per group, folding in per-group failure rates if a matching `*.errors.json` exists. Local, CPU-only — no GPU/Databricks needed for this step.
* `evaluation/viewer/`: A local, read-only UI for browsing `predictions.jsonl` files (article/prediction/reference), filling the gap between raw jsonl and the live Colab notebook. `data.py` has the Streamlit-free data logic (`discover_predictions_files`, `load_predictions` — applies `strip_think`, `filter_by_keyword`, `common_length`), importable from a notebook/REPL; `__init__.py` re-exports it; `app.py` is the thin Streamlit script (`streamlit run evaluation/viewer/app.py`) that renders Hebrew right-to-left, supports keyword search, and compares 2+ systems side-by-side for the same article. Local, CPU-only, no GPU/API. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-predictions-viewer-design.md`.
* `notebooks/evaluation_observation.ipynb`: The **evaluation-observation** stage. A self-bootstrapping Colab notebook that runs the *real* evaluation functions live and **displays** the per-example process (article → model summary → reference → judge faithfulness/fluency → error-analysis failure labels) for finetuned/base/gemini. Loads existing Hub predictions (finetuned/base at repo root, gemini under `reports/`) and generates fresh summaries on a T4. Judge/error/browse cells are API+CPU; only the generation cell needs a GPU.
* `notebooks/cluster_topics_databricks.py`: Databricks source-format notebook (`# Databricks notebook source` / `# COMMAND ----------` cell markers) driving `evaluation/topic_clustering.py` and `evaluation/style_labels.py`. Manual, occasional run on a Databricks GPU cluster — the GPU is for speed, not required (the embedding model is 0.4B params, encoder-only, the same class of job as the local-CPU AlephBERT BERTScore step). Clones the repo (or reuses an uploaded Workspace copy) so it calls the same tested functions rather than duplicating logic; computes both `topic_label` (BERTopic) and `style_label` (regex) over the same records. Plots (all inline via `displayHTML`, small enough to skip the DBFS round-trip): a `plot_topic_sizes` cluster-size bar chart, an interactive 2D/3D cluster scatter (`plot_clusters(dimensions=2|3)`, `plot_dimensions` widget; written to DBFS + iframe-embedded since 10k-doc hovers exceed the ~20 MB cell-output cap), a `plot_style_distribution` bar chart, and a topic×style stacked bar chart alongside the crosstab table. Writes one `topics.jsonl`/`topics-summary.json` (carrying both label fields) to DBFS for manual download into `outputs/data/raw/` and `outputs/results/`. Widgets expose `min_cluster_size`/`min_samples`/`reduce_outliers`/`nr_topics`/`merge_duplicate_labels`/`topic_size_plot_top_n`/`plot_dimensions` so noise/near-duplicate-topic tuning (see `topic_clustering.py`) doesn't require editing the notebook. A scoped, one-off departure from AMLK's default local/HF-Jobs/Colab stack — no agent-driven Databricks deployment (no MCP connection today), the notebook is handed off for manual import/run.
* `scripts/run_nb_cell.py`: Agent cell-runner — reads the notebook with `nbformat` and execs a chosen code cell / range against a persistent Colab session via `colab exec` (the Colab CLI has no native `.ipynb` runner). `--list` shows cell indices; the caller owns `colab new`/`stop`. This is how an agent observes the eval cell-by-cell.
* `tests/`: 49 fast behavioral tests + 2 gated live tests (Gemini judge; BERTopic fit + Gemini topic naming + plot), all passing.

## Building and Running

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.10+
* `uv` package manager (used instead of pip — `uv` is on PATH)
* Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `uv sync` if using a lockfile)
* Fill in `.env`:
  * `HF_TOKEN` — HuggingFace access token (model download + HF Hub upload)
  * `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Gemini API key (advanced baseline + LLM-judge + error analysis)
  * wandb auth is read from `~/.netrc` (global); the HF job also needs `WANDB_API_KEY`, picked up automatically.
* Source the env and activate venv before running scripts: `source .env && source .venv/bin/activate`
* **Always invoke scripts as modules** (`python -m data.preprocess`, `python -m training.train`, …)
  so package imports resolve from the repo root. This is the one supported way to run them.
* **Never load or run a model on the local GPU** — this machine (8 GB) freezes. All Qwen3-2B
  training and inference run on **HuggingFace Jobs**. Local is only for: data download/preprocess
  (CPU), `pytest`, the Gemini baseline + judge + error analysis (API), and BERTScore (pinned to CPU).

**Running the full pipeline:**
```bash
source .env && source .venv/bin/activate

# 1. Download datasets  →  outputs/data/raw/combined.jsonl (10,000 records)   [local, CPU]
python -m data.download

# 2. Preprocess: prompt/completion pairs + 80/10/10 split. --variant selects the probe input.  [local, CPU]
python -m data.preprocess --variant whole        # also: --variant lead | body

# 3. Train on HF Jobs (cloud GPU). The job also generates fine-tuned + zero-shot base test
#    predictions and pushes predictions-finetuned.jsonl / predictions-base.jsonl to the model repo.
python -m training.train --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi --smoke-test   # verify first (~$0.05)
python -m training.train --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi                # full run

# 4. Run the whole eval battery on HF Jobs (cheap CPU). Generates the Gemini baseline and scores
#    all 3 systems (finetuned/base/gemini) with ROUGE + BERTScore + judge + error analysis, pushing
#    reports/*.json to the model repo. Done on the cloud so the ~4000 Gemini calls + BERTScore are
#    off the user's weak local connection.
python -m evaluation.eval_hf_job --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi --smoke-test   # 5 examples, verify first (~pennies)
python -m evaluation.eval_hf_job --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi                # full run (cpu-upgrade, ~$0.10-0.30)

# 5. Assemble the D1 comparison tables (downloads the tiny report JSONs):  [local, no GPU/API]
python -m evaluation.build_report_tables --output outputs/results/d1-tables.md

# (Local alternative to step 4, if you have a fast connection: run the scripts directly —
#  evaluation.predict for the Gemini baseline, then evaluation.evaluate / evaluation.error_analysis
#  on each of predictions-finetuned.jsonl / predictions-base.jsonl / the gemini file.)
```

**HuggingFace Jobs — submit and monitor:**
```bash
# --submit-hf uploads outputs/data/processed/<variant>/ to the Hub (avreymi/amlk-training-data[-<variant>])
# then submits train_hf_job.py inline (a10g-large, 6h, 1-epoch QLoRA). It prints a Job ID.
python -m training.train --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi               # full run
python -m training.train --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi --smoke-test  # 10 steps, a10g-small, ~$0.05 — verify first
python -m training.train --submit-hf --hf-user avreymi --inference-only  # regen predictions from pushed adapter (a10g-small, 1h)
# Cost: a10g-small has the SAME 24 GB A10G GPU as a10g-large at $1.00/h vs $1.50/h —
# prefer a10g-small; prefer --method lora over qlora for the 2B model.
# See docs/2026-06-12-qlora-training-job-postmortem.md before launching the probe runs.

hf jobs ps                    # list recent jobs
hf jobs logs <job-id>         # snapshot; add -f to stream
hf jobs inspect <job-id>

# Trained adapter (LoRA only, not merged): https://huggingface.co/avreymi/amlk-qwen3-2b-sft  (private)
# Evaluation loads it via: predict.py --model finetuned --adapter avreymi/amlk-qwen3-2b-sft
# Training metrics: wandb project "amlk-hebrew-summarization".
```

**Reading model outputs (predictions viewer):**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run evaluation/viewer/app.py
# Opens a local browser UI over outputs/results/*.jsonl: RTL Hebrew, keyword search,
# side-by-side comparison across systems (finetuned/base/gemini). Local, CPU-only, read-only.
```

**Running tests:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## Status - remember to update it

**Stages A + B complete as of 2026-06-12.** Stack: trl 1.6.0, transformers 5.11, peft 0.19, wandb 0.27.
- `data/download.py` — 10,000 records from biunlp/HeSum in `outputs/data/raw/combined.jsonl`. IAHLT/summarization_he is inaccessible (not on HF Hub with current credentials).
- `data/preprocess.py` — prompt/completion pairs + `--variant whole|lead|body`; 8,000/1,000/1,000 splits in `outputs/data/processed/<variant>/`.
- `training/train.py` — one trainer for qlora|lora|full, `completion_only_loss=True`, wandb logging, `--submit-hf` to HF Jobs. Verified: local 12-step QLoRA smoke runs and logs to wandb.
- `training/train_hf_job.py` — self-contained HF Jobs script (trl 1.6 API, wandb).
- `evaluation/predict.py` / `evaluate.py` / `error_analysis.py` — full metric battery (ROUGE/BERTScore/Gemini judge), zero-shot + Gemini baselines, failure-type analysis. `strip_think()` (in predict.py) drops closed Qwen3 `<think>…</think>` reasoning before scoring; evaluate.py has `--limit` for smoke runs.
- `evaluation/eval_hf_job.py` + `build_report_tables.py` — D1 eval runs on a cheap CPU HF Job (clones the public repo, drives the existing CLIs, pushes `reports/*.json`); the tables tool turns those reports into the presentation markdown. Chosen because the user has weak internet (the ~4000 Gemini calls + BERTScore run cloud-side). Smoke job `6a2cfda2` verified the path end-to-end.
- 16 fast tests + 1 gated live Gemini test, all passing (`python -m pytest tests/`).
- HF Jobs dataset: `avreymi/amlk-training-data` (private). Model output: `avreymi/amlk-qwen3-2b-sft` (private). wandb project: `amlk-hebrew-summarization`. Advanced baseline + judge: Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (full 2.5-flash's ~7s/call thinking latency made the ~4000-call battery ~10h; -lite is ~1s/call, ~6x faster. 2.0-flash is retired.)
- Note: QLoRA `push_to_hub` saves the LoRA adapter only (not merged) — evaluation loads base + adapter via `PeftModel.from_pretrained` (handled in `predict.py`).
- Note: the Gemini LLM-judge and the Gemini advanced baseline are the same model family — flag the possible self-preference bias in the paper.
- **2026-06-12 full run (job `6a2bc974`): training succeeded** (1 epoch, eval_loss 1.777; adapter on `avreymi/amlk-qwen3-2b-sft`), but the job timed out in its prediction loop — predictions regenerated by a patched inference-only job. Full post-mortem with cost analysis and the probe-run checklist: `docs/2026-06-12-qlora-training-job-postmortem.md`.
- **v1 adapter flaw (addressed 2026-06-27): Qwen3-2B is a hybrid-attention model (18 linear-attention + 6 full-attention layers); the v1 LoRA `target_modules` q/k/v/o only exist in the 6 full-attention layers, so it covered 6/24 layers (0.07% trainable params).** `LoRAConfig` now adds the MLP projections `gate/up/down_proj` (present in all 24 layers) and bumps r→32/alpha→64; mirrored in `train_hf_job.py`. The next run validates this; still consider the linear-attention modules + `flash-linear-attention`/`causal-conv1d` deps (post-mortem §5.1) if coverage is still insufficient.
- `train_hf_job.py` / `evaluation/infer.py` share a decode config: `max_new_tokens=256` (p99 reference length is 187 tokens), `min_new_tokens=16`, `no_repeat_ngram_size=3`, `repetition_penalty=1.2`, explicit `eos_token_id`/`pad_token_id`, greedy. Predictions are pushed immediately after each generation loop (timeout-safe), progress every 10 batches; inference-only jobs use a 1h timeout. `PRED_SUFFIX` env (`--pred-suffix`) appends e.g. `-v2` so a re-decode doesn't clobber v1.

**2026-07-04 — Optional 3D cluster plot.** `plot_clusters(..., dimensions=2|3)` adds a rotatable 3D UMAP view (convex-hull mesh clouds + centroid text labels); Databricks widget `plot_dimensions` defaults to `2`. 2D remains the default for the iframe embed.

**2026-07-04 — Refinement coarsened after 60+ cluster explosion.** The first refinement pass (25/8, no topic cap) split the politics mega-cluster into 60+ near-duplicate "תקשורת ו…" Gemini labels. Defaults now: `refine_min_cluster_size=100`, `refine_min_samples=20`, `refine_nr_topics=12` (BERTopic merge cap on the refinement pass only), stricter refinement naming prompt forbidding "תקשורת/עיתונות/…" meta-labels. Expect ~15–20 topics total (5 pass-1 + ~12 politics sub-domains). Set `refine_oversized=False` to keep ~6 pass-1 topics only.

**2026-07-04 — Two-stage mega-cluster refinement.** Pass 1 still uses coarse HDBSCAN (60/15) for stable top-level domains; `refine_large_clusters()` (on by default, `refine_oversized=True`) re-clusters any topic holding ≥30% of docs with finer settings on the *same* embeddings and a sub-domain Gemini naming prompt — splits the ~7.6k politics blob without re-embedding or re-fragmenting sports/legal. Databricks widgets: `refine_oversized`, `refine_size_fraction`, `refine_min_cluster_size`, `refine_min_samples`, `refine_nr_topics`.

**2026-07-04 — Topic-clustering "fewer, more distinct topics" fix (v3) + notebook plots.** The v2 fix (embed on `text`) still surfaced too many near-duplicate topics (e.g. "תקשורת ומדיה"/"תקשורת וטלוויזיה") once mega-topic collapse was fixed, driven by (a) layout/journalism-meta keywords ("כותרת", "הבוקר", "העיתון"...) dominating c-TF-IDF instead of real subject words, and (b) fine HDBSCAN granularity producing several sub-clusters of the same domain that Gemini then named identically. Fixed in `evaluation/topic_clustering.py`: a `BOILERPLATE_STOPWORDS` set added to the vectorizer; `min_cluster_size`/`min_samples` raised 25/5 → 60/15 (coarser HDBSCAN); a new `merge_duplicate_labels()` post-processing step (on by default, `cluster_dataset(merge_duplicates=True)`) that collapses any clusters Gemini still named identically into one reported topic, keeping the smallest `cluster_id` and the union of keywords — no extra Gemini calls. Databricks widgets: `min_cluster_size`/`min_samples` defaults updated, new `merge_duplicate_labels` toggle. Also added inline Plotly charts to the notebook pipeline (`plot_topic_sizes` in `topic_clustering.py`, `plot_style_distribution` in `style_labels.py`, plus a topic×style stacked bar) alongside the existing big document scatter — small aggregate charts shown directly with `displayHTML(fig.to_html(...))`, no DBFS round-trip needed since they're nowhere near the ~20 MB cell-output cap.

**2026-07-04 — Topic-clustering granularity fix (v2).** After the noise/vectorizer fixes, a second full run collapsed ~99% of docs into one "חדשות ותקשורת" mega-topic — caused by clustering on summaries (outlet-name headlines), `outlier_threshold=0` (force-assign all noise to the largest cluster), and `nr_topics='auto'` over-merging. Defaults now: `embed_field='text'` (first 4k chars of article body), `outlier_threshold=0.35`, `nr_topics=None`, `min_cluster_size=25`/`min_samples=5`, media-outlet stopwords + domain-focused Gemini naming prompt. Databricks widgets updated (`embed_field`, `outlier_threshold`, `max_embed_chars`; `nr_topics` blank by default).

**2026-07-04 — Topic-clustering quality fix (v1).** The first full 10k-doc Databricks run put 51% of docs in the noise cluster (-1) and produced near-duplicate topic names (e.g. "תקשורת ומדיה" / "תקשורת וטלוויזיה") whose c-TF-IDF keywords were mostly years/IDs/Latin site names (`ynet`, `nrg`, `bbc`) — BERTopic's default English-tuned vectorizer let non-Hebrew tokens dominate. Fixed in `evaluation/topic_clustering.py`: a Hebrew-only `CountVectorizer` (`_build_vectorizer`/`HEBREW_TOKEN_PATTERN`/`HEBREW_STOPWORDS`), `min_samples` decoupled from `min_cluster_size` (per BERTopic's FAQ, reduces raw noise), and two opt-out BERTopic post-processing passes — `reduce_outliers` (embedding-similarity reassignment of noise docs) and `nr_topics="auto"` (HDBSCAN-over-topic-vectors merging of only genuinely similar topics). All exposed as Databricks widgets (`min_cluster_size` default lowered 100→40, `min_samples`, `reduce_outliers`, `nr_topics`) so re-tuning doesn't require editing the notebook. 3 new fast unit tests cover the Hebrew token pattern/stopwords.

**2026-07-04 — Predictions viewer added.** `evaluation/viewer/` (`data.py` + `app.py`, its own subfolder): a local Streamlit app (`streamlit run evaluation/viewer/app.py`) for browsing `outputs/results/*.jsonl` — RTL Hebrew rendering, keyword search, side-by-side comparison across systems. Read-only, CPU-only, no GPU/API. Verified end-to-end against the real `predictions-finetuned.jsonl`/`predictions-base.jsonl` files with `streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest` (file discovery, multi-file compare, keyword filtering, navigation — no exceptions). Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-04-predictions-viewer-design.md`.

**2026-06-27–28 — Hebrew-summarization fix batch (decoding + training + Hebrew-aware eval). All three phases complete.**
- *Eval (Phase 0, live):* `evaluate.py` BERTScore now defaults to `onlplab/alephbert-base` (HeSum-comparable, more discriminative than xlm-r) and reports both raw and Hebrew-normalized ROUGE.
- *Decoding (Phase 1):* shared generation adds `no_repeat_ngram_size=3`, `repetition_penalty=1.2`, `min_new_tokens=16`, explicit EOS. **Job `6a3f8e18…` ran 2026-06-27.** Finding: decoding alone lowered every metric (ROUGE-1 11.4→4.7, AlephBERT F1 0.45→0.38) — the v1 repetition loops inflated ROUGE by accident; suppressing them revealed fundamental undertraining.
- *Training (Phase 2):* 3 epochs, LoRA r→32/alpha→64 + MLP modules (`gate/up/down_proj`), "in up to 3 sentences" prompt cap. **Job `6a3fa247…` ran 2026-06-28, completed epoch 3.0** (eval_loss 1.712, best checkpoint auto-loaded). `predictions-finetuned.jsonl` + `predictions-base.jsonl` both pushed to Hub. Scored (`outputs/results/finetuned-v3.report.json`): ROUGE-1 5.1, AlephBERT F1 0.390. V3 generates fluent, format-correct Hebrew but hallucinates content (correct style, wrong facts). Marginal improvement over v2 (ROUGE-1 4.7, BS 0.383). LLM-judge required to evaluate faithfulness — **BLOCKED on Gemini API billing**.

**Next steps:**
1. **D.1 — DONE (2026-06-13).** Full eval battery ran on HF Jobs (job `6a2d1448`, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, n=1000 × 3 systems); tables in `outputs/results/d1-tables.md` via `evaluation.build_report_tables`. **Key results:** fine-tuning lifted ROUGE-1 (0.114 vs base 0.069) and BERTScore (0.850 vs 0.829) but the judge rated base *slightly higher* on faithfulness (2.98 vs 2.64) and fluency (3.80 vs 3.67) — a ROUGE-vs-human-judgement misalignment, driven by the fine-tuned model's degenerate repetition + more hallucination (0.22) and lead-copying (0.38). Gemini is a strong upper bound (faith 4.96, flu 5.00, 0% sampled failures). Zero-shot base is unusable raw: 22% non-Hebrew, 44% produce only `<think>` reasoning. (Deliverable is markdown tables — the presentation SVG is flattened paths, not editable text.)
2. **Truncation probe** — train/evaluate whole / lead / body variants by **30.06** (`--variant` is ready). **First apply the post-mortem checklist (§7): extended LoRA target modules, a10g-small, `--method lora`, fast-path deps.**
3. **Literature (English summarization)** — document lessons from English news summarization in the paper (lead bias, ROUGE limits, baseline practices).
4. **Journalism / headline control (optional)** — alternate instruction templates for headline-length vs longer summaries; see `TODO.md` H.

Final submission: **31.07**.

## Code Writing Rules
Do not create new documentation files (unless explicitly requested). Only update documentation via the `README` if necessary.

### File Header (Mandatory)
In the header of every code file, you **must** describe how that file relates to the **overall project architecture** and **code flow**.

Each code file **must** include a short description (no more than 4–5 sentences) that explains the following:
- Its role in the **big picture** (as defined in the **Project Structure** section).
- Its connection to the main **code flow** of the project.
- The intended **execution environment** (where this code will run, as defined in the **Project Goal** section).
- The skills, memory, shared docs are very important to continue working on the project. You have all these as live files and currently updating them is very very important. Remember to do it!
